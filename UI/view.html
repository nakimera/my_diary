                When I received Challenge One of the Andela Women Tech Leadership Program, I was super excited about the idea of building a working application from scratch. 
                As an artist by talent, and designer by choice, I came up with a few mock-ups of my desired application using Balsamiq mock-up tool. 
                I put on my full Wakanda armor, and warrior attitude, ready to unleash the programmer in me.

                To my surprise, I was required to first create user stories on some Pivotal Tracker. 
                “ I already have an idea of how I want my app to look like. A big idea for that matter. 
                Why not just dive into the code?” I wondered. Who is this pivotal tracker guy anyway, 
                and what’s with him and stories? Oh well, we all like stories. Good stories. I will tell him a story.
            
            </p>
            <p>
                I remembered I had heard the words “Pivotal Tracker” from a friend who had done Andela boot-camp. 
                But clearly, I had no idea why it was so important for a software development project. 
                I asked my immediate neighbor about this pivotal tracker and the only thing she knew was 
                I had to first go to pivotaltracker.com and create an account. That was easy. 
                I looked at the interface and thought to myself, “everything is labelled, I am a developer, 
                it’s just software like Whatsapp. I don’t need a manual to figure it out”. 
            </p>   
                
            <p>
                My unexpected journey around pivotal tracker began. 
                I definitely had other plans, quicker plans. At least that is what I thought. 
                This time I only put on my programming boots. I looked around, and the interface didn’t look sophisticated at all. 
                On the contrary, it was so friendly. I located the Add story feature on the spot. 
                As I started writing actual user stories, the smile on my face slowly started fading. 
                I realized I was wrong. Pivotal Tracker is not like WhatsApp. I continued anyway. 
                I added a title and moved on. I had to select one option from feature, bug and chore.
                 I picked feature for no good reason. I kept moving on until I realized I had no clue 
                 about what the tool does or how to use it.
